# Budget Tracker-AV
This challenge is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection.
## Description
* The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. 
* A budget tracker application without an internet connection provides the user a notification, when the user inputs an expense or deposit.
* When the user reestablishes an internet connection, then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.

## Built with
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
